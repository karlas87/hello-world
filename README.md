Hello!


Karla here.  I have dreams of conquering the world.  I can type whatever I want here, because no one will ever read it.  And when I have taken over the world, no one can say I didn't warn them.  Muahahaha!

First, I will make everyone think I'm the most trustworthy person ever.

Second, I will learn everyones' secrets.

Finally, I will use those secrets to take advantage of everyones' weaknesses.

Muahahahaha! Muahahahahahahahaha!

Psych!  Had you going there didn't I?
